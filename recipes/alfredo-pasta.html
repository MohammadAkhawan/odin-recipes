        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A friend of mine got this recipe while traveling in Italy. Chicken,
            mushrooms, and tortellini in rich cream sauce. Delicious! Serve
            sprinkled with parsley and cheese.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cheese tortellini</li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
            <li>boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>garlic powder</li>
            <li>heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>fresh parsley</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
                tortellini. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float
                to the top and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and
                stir chicken breast in hot oil until no longer pink in the
                center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
                mushrooms and garlic powder until mushrooms begin to soften,
                about 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to a
                boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly
                thickened, about 3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, and
                salt. Continue to cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir tortellini and chicken into mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer
                until heated through, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
